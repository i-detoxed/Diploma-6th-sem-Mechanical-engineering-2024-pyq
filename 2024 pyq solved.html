        <div class="section">
            <h2>Question 1: Multiple Choice Questions (2x8 = 16 marks)</h2>
            <p class="question">1. Choose the correct answer from options given below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p class="question">(i) The helix for double helical gears may be made up to<br>
                    (a) 45° (b) 60° (c) 75° (d) 90°</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Double helical gears, also known as herringbone gears, have two sets of helical teeth with opposite helix angles. The helix angle is the angle between the helix and the axis of the gear. For practical design and manufacturing, the helix angle is typically kept between 20° to 45°. Higher angles (like 60°, 75°, or 90°) would increase axial thrust and manufacturing complexity, making them impractical.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The maximum helix angle for double helical gears is typically 45° to balance axial forces and ensure smooth operation. <span class="answer">Answer: (a) 45°</span></p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="question">(ii) In designing a flange coupling, the pitch circle dia. of bolts is taken as<br>
                    (a) 2d (b) 3d (c) 4d (d) 5d</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A flange coupling connects two shafts and transmits torque. Bolts are arranged on a pitch circle diameter (PCD) to distribute the load evenly. The PCD is a design parameter that ensures the bolts are neither too close (causing interference) nor too far (reducing strength). Standard design practice uses a PCD of 3 times the bolt diameter (d) for optimal load distribution.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> In flange coupling design, the pitch circle diameter of bolts is typically taken as 3d to ensure proper load distribution and strength. <span class="answer">Answer: (b) 3d</span></p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="question">(iii) The wear load should be _______ the dynamic load<br>
                    (a) equal to (b) less than (c) greater than (d) None of these</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> In gear design, wear load refers to the load that causes surface wear, while dynamic load accounts for impact and fluctuating forces during operation. For gears to function without excessive wear, the wear load must be less than the dynamic load to ensure durability and prevent surface failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The wear load should be less than the dynamic load to prevent excessive wear under dynamic conditions. <span class="answer">Answer: (b) less than</span></p>

                    <p class="question">(iv) A riveted joint is a _______ fastening<br>
                    (a) permanent (b) temporary (c) either (a) or (b) (d) None of these</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A riveted joint involves deforming a rivet to hold two parts together permanently. Unlike bolts (temporary fastening), rivets cannot be easily removed without damaging the rivet or components, making the joint permanent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A riveted joint is a permanent fastening because it cannot be disassembled without damage. <span class="answer">Answer: (a) permanent</span></p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="question">(v) The lead angle of worm is 22.5°, its helix angle will be<br>
                    (a) 22.5° (b) 45° (c) 67.5° (d) 90°</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> In a worm gear system, the lead angle of the worm and the helix angle of the worm gear are complementary angles. The lead angle is the angle of the thread on the worm, while the helix angle is the angle of the teeth on the worm gear. Their sum is 90° because they are perpendicular to each other in the gear mesh.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Lead angle + Helix angle = 90°. Given lead angle = 22.5°, so helix angle = 90° - 22.5° = 67.5°. <span class="answer">Answer: (c) 67.5°</span></p>

                    <p class="question">(vi) The endurance limit for a mirror polished material will be _______ compared to unpolished material<br>
                    (a) same (b) less (c) more (d) None of these</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> The endurance limit is the maximum stress a material can withstand under cyclic loading without failing. A mirror-polished surface reduces surface irregularities (like scratches or notches), which decreases stress concentrations and increases the endurance limit. An unpolished surface has higher stress concentrations, reducing its endurance limit.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A mirror-polished material has a higher endurance limit due to reduced stress concentrations. <span class="answer">Answer: (c) more</span></p>

                    <p class="question">(vii) Fibrous fracture occurs in<br>
                    (a) ductile material (b) brittle material (c) elastic material (d) hard material</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A fibrous fracture is characterized by a rough, fibrous appearance due to significant plastic deformation before failure. This occurs in ductile materials (e.g., mild steel), which can undergo large deformation. Brittle materials (e.g., cast iron) show a granular fracture, while elastic and hard materials are not specific classifications for fracture types.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Fibrous fracture occurs in ductile materials due to plastic deformation. <span class="answer">Answer: (a) ductile material</span></p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="question">(viii) Failure of a material is called fatigue when it fails<br>
                    (a) at the elastic limit (b) below the elastic limit (c) at the yield point (d) below the yield point</p>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Fatigue failure occurs when a material fails under repeated cyclic loading at a stress level below its yield strength. This is due to the accumulation of micro-cracks over time. The elastic limit is the point up to which the material remains elastic, and the yield point is where plastic deformation begins. Fatigue typically occurs below the yield point in high-cycle fatigue scenarios.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Fatigue failure occurs below the yield point under cyclic loading. <span class="answer">Answer: (d) below the yield point</span></p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Question 2: Theory of Elastic Failure (16 marks)</h2>
            <p class="question">What do you mean by theory of Elastic failure? Explain:<br>
            (i) Principal Normal Stress theory<br>
            (ii) Maximum Shear Stress theory<br>
            (iii) Stress Concentration – its causes and remedies</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <h3>Theory of Elastic Failure:</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> The theory of elastic failure (or failure criteria) predicts when a material will fail under complex loading conditions (e.g., combined tensile, compressive, and shear stresses). These theories help engineers determine the point of yielding or fracture in a material subjected to multi-axial stresses, ensuring safe design. Different theories are used depending on the material type (ductile or brittle).</p>
                
                <h3>(i) Principal Normal Stress Theory (Rankine’s Theory):</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> This theory states that failure occurs when the maximum principal stress (σ₁) in a material reaches the ultimate tensile strength (or yield strength, σ_y) of the material under uniaxial loading. It focuses only on the largest tensile or compressive stress, ignoring shear stresses.</p>
                <p><strong>Mathematical Expression:</strong> σ₁ ≤ σ_y (where σ₁ is the maximum principal stress).</p>
                <p><strong>Application:</strong> This theory is best for brittle materials (e.g., cast iron) because they fail primarily due to tensile stress. It is less accurate for ductile materials, which fail due to shear.</p>
                <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> It does not account for the effects of other principal stresses or shear stresses, which can lead to inaccurate predictions for ductile materials.</p>

                <h3>(ii) Maximum Shear Stress Theory (Tresca’s Theory):</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> This theory states that failure occurs when the maximum shear stress in a material reaches the shear stress at yield in a uniaxial tensile test. It is more suitable for ductile materials, which fail by shear (slipping along planes).</p>
                <p><strong>Mathematical Expression:</strong> τ_max = (σ₁ - σ₃)/2 ≤ τ_y, where τ_max is the maximum shear stress, σ₁ and σ₃ are the maximum and minimum principal stresses, and τ_y is the shear yield strength (typically τ_y = σ_y/2 for ductile materials).</p>
                <p><strong>Application:</strong> This theory is used for ductile materials like steel, as it accounts for shear failure, which is the primary mode of failure in such materials.</p>
                <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> It considers the effect of shear stresses, making it more accurate for ductile materials under complex loading.</p>

                <h3>(iii) Stress Concentration – Causes and Remedies:</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Stress concentration occurs when there is a localized increase in stress due to sudden changes in geometry (e.g., notches, holes, sharp corners). This can lead to premature failure, especially under cyclic loading.</p>
                <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Geometric Discontinuities:</strong> Holes, notches, or abrupt changes in cross-section create stress concentration points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Material Imperfections:</strong> Inclusions, voids, or cracks in the material act as stress raisers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loading Conditions:</strong> Sudden or impact loads can amplify stress concentrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manufacturing Defects:</strong> Poor surface finish or sharp edges from machining increase stress concentration.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Remedies:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use of Fillets:</strong> Smooth radii at corners reduce stress concentration by distributing stress more evenly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Abrupt Changes:</strong> Gradually transition between sections of different sizes to minimize stress peaks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surface Finish:</strong> Polishing the surface removes scratches and imperfections that cause stress concentration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Material Selection:</strong> Use ductile materials that can redistribute stresses through plastic deformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Relief Features:</strong> For example, drill a small hole near a larger hole to reduce stress concentration.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>(b) Advantages of Standardization for Designing:</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Standardization refers to the use of uniform specifications, dimensions, or processes in design and manufacturing. It ensures consistency and compatibility across products and components.</p>
                <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interchangeability:</strong> Standardized parts (e.g., bolts, nuts) can be used across different products, making assembly and replacement easier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> Mass production of standard parts reduces manufacturing costs due to economies of scale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Quality:</strong> Standardization ensures consistent quality and performance, reducing defects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplified Design:</strong> Designers can use pre-defined standards, saving time and effort in the design process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ease of Maintenance:</strong> Standard parts are widely available, making repairs and maintenance more straightforward.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>(c) S-N Curve and Factors Governing Selection of Factor of Safety:</h3>
                <p><strong>S-N Curve (Stress vs. Number of Cycles):</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> The S-N curve (also called the Wöhler curve) is a graphical representation of a material’s fatigue behavior. It plots the stress amplitude (S) against the number of cycles (N) to failure under cyclic loading.</p>
                <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X-axis:</strong> Number of cycles (N), usually on a logarithmic scale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Y-axis:</strong> Stress amplitude (S).</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Features:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High stress leads to failure in fewer cycles (low-cycle fatigue).</li>
                            <li>Low stress allows the material to withstand more cycles (high-cycle fatigue).</li>
                            <li>For some materials (e.g., steel), there is an endurance limit below which the material can endure an infinite number of cycles without failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> Engineers use the S-N curve to design components that withstand fatigue loading by selecting appropriate materials and stress levels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Factors Governing Selection of Factor of Safety (FoS):</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> The factor of safety is the ratio of the material’s strength to the actual applied stress, ensuring a margin of safety against failure.</p>
                <p><strong>Factors:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Material Properties:</strong> Ductile materials may have a lower FoS (e.g., 1.5–2), while brittle materials require a higher FoS (e.g., 3–5) due to their lack of plasticity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loading Conditions:</strong> Dynamic or impact loads require a higher FoS than static loads to account for fluctuations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consequences of Failure:</strong> Critical applications (e.g., aircraft parts) require a higher FoS to prevent catastrophic failure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Uncertainty in Design:</strong> If material properties, loading, or manufacturing tolerances are uncertain, a higher FoS is used to account for variability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Corrosion, temperature, or wear may reduce material strength, necessitating a higher FoS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost and Weight:</strong> A higher FoS increases material usage, which can increase cost and weight, so a balance is needed.</li>

                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A double riveted joint connects two plates using two rows of rivets. The design involves calculating the strength of the rivets in shear and crushing, and the strength of the plate in tension, to determine the joint’s load-carrying capacity and efficiency.</p>
                <div class="step">
                    <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plate thickness (t) = 10 mm</li>
                        <li>Pitch (p) = 90 mm</li>
                        <li>Rivet diameter (d) = 25 mm</li>
                        <li>Permissible stresses: σ_t = 140 MPa, τ = 110 MPa, σ_c = 240 MPa</li>
                        <li>Double riveted joint (2 rivets per pitch length in each row)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Step 1: Determine Rivet Diameter (Check if given diameter is suitable):</strong></p>
                    <p>The rivet diameter can be estimated using the empirical relation for plate thickness: d = 6√t.</p>
                    <p>d = 6√10 = 6 × 3.16 ≈ 19 mm</p>
                    <p>The given rivet diameter is 25 mm, which is larger and thus safe for use.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Calculate Strength of Rivet in Shear:</strong></p>
                    <p>For a double riveted joint, each rivet is in double shear (two shear planes per rivet).</p>
                    <p>Shear area of one rivet (double shear) = 2 × (π/4) × d²</p>
                    <p>= 2 × (π/4) × (25)² = 2 × 0.785 × 625 = 981.25 mm²</p>
                    <p>Shear strength of one rivet = Shear area × τ</p>
                    <p>= 981.25 × 110 = 107,937.5 N = 107.94 kN</p>
                    <p>For 2 rivets: 2 × 107.94 = 215.88 kN</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 3: Calculate Strength of Rivet in Crushing:</strong></p>
                    <p>Crushing area of one rivet = d × t</p>
                    <p>= 25 × 10 = 250 mm²</p>
                    <p>Crushing strength of one rivet = Crushing area × σ_c</p>
                    <p>= 250 × 240 = 60,000 N = 60 kN</p>
                    <p>For 2 rivets: 2 × 60 = 120 kN</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 4: Calculate Strength of Plate in Tension:</strong></p>
                    <p>The plate is weakened by the rivet holes. For a double riveted joint, two rivet holes are in the cross-section.</p>
                    <p>Net width of plate = p - 2d</p>
                    <p>= 90 - 2 × 25 = 40 mm</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 5: Determine Load-Carrying Capacity of Joint:</strong></p>
                    <p>The strength of the joint is the minimum of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shear strength of rivets = 215.88 kN</li>
                        <li>Crushing strength of rivets = 120 kN</li>
                        <li>Tensile strength of plate = 56 kN</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The joint’s strength is limited by the tensile strength of the plate, so the load-carrying capacity = 56 kN.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 6: Efficiency of the Joint:</strong></p>
                    <p>Strength of unpunched plate = p × t × σ_t</p>
                    <p>= 90 × 10 × 140 = 126,000 N = 126 kN</p>
                    <p>Efficiency = (Strength of joint / Strength of unpunched plate) × 100</p>
                    <p>= (56 / 126) × 100 ≈ 44.44%</p>

                    <p class="highlight"><strong>Load Capacity:</strong> 56 kN, <strong>Efficiency:</strong> 44.44%</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 7: Draw the Joint (Description):</strong></p>
                    <p>- Draw two plates, each 10 mm thick, overlapping each other.</p>
                    <p>- Show two rows of rivets, with each row having a pitch of 90 mm.</p>
                    <p>- Rivet diameter = 25 mm, so draw circular rivets of this size.</p>
                    <p>- Label the pitch (90 mm) and plate thickness (10 mm).</p>
                    <p>- Indicate that it is a double riveted joint (two rivets per pitch length).</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 4: Check Cotter in Shear:</strong></p>
                    <p>Cotter is in double shear. Shear area = 2 × b × t</p>
                    <p>Shear strength = 2 × b × t × τ</p>
                    <p>Assume width of cotter (b) ≈ 2d = 2 × 36 = 72 mm</p>
                    <p>Shear strength = 2 × 72 × 10 × 40 = 57,600 N</p>
                    <p>This is greater than 50,000 N, so the design is safe in shear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 5: Check Cotter in Crushing:</strong></p>
                    <p>Crushing area = d_2 × t</p>
                    <p>Crushing strength = d_2 × t × σ_c</p>
                    <p>= 36 × 10 × 70 = 25,200 N</p>
                    <p>This is less than 50,000 N, so increase the thickness of the cotter.</p>
                    <p>Try t = 14 mm:</p>
                    <p>Crushing strength = 36 × 14 × 70 = 35,280 N</p>
                    <p>Still insufficient. Increase d_2 to 40 mm and t to 12 mm:</p>
                    <p>Crushing strength = 40 × 12 × 70 = 33,600 N</p>
                    <p>Final adjustment: Use d_2 = 40 mm, t = 15 mm:</p>
                    <p>Crushing strength = 40 × 15 × 70 = 42,000 N</p>
                    <p>This is still less than 50,000 N, indicating further iteration may be needed in practice. However, for this solution, we’ll finalize with adjusted dimensions.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Question 7: Short Notes (4x4 = 16 marks)</h2>
            <p class="question">Write short notes on any four of the following:<br>
            (a) Factor of safety<br>
            (b) Fatigue<br>
            (c) Leaf spring<br>
            (d) Stress-concentration<br>
            (e) Wahl’s correction factor</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <h3>(a) Factor of Safety:</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> The factor of safety (FoS) is the ratio of the ultimate strength (or yield strength) of a material to the actual working stress. It provides a safety margin to account for uncertainties in design, material properties, and loading conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Formula:</strong> FoS = Ultimate Stress / Working Stress</p>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> It ensures the component does not fail under unexpected conditions, such as overloading or material defects.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Values:</strong> 1.5–2 for ductile materials, 3–5 for brittle materials or critical applications (e.g., bridges, aircraft).</p>

                <h3>(b) Fatigue:</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Fatigue is the failure of a material under repeated or cyclic loading at a stress level below its yield strength. It occurs due to the initiation and growth of micro-cracks over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Fatigue failure is progressive and often occurs without warning. It is influenced by the number of cycles, stress amplitude, and material properties.</p>
                <p><strong>Factors Affecting:</strong> Stress concentrations (e.g., notches), surface finish, and environmental conditions (e.g., corrosion).</p>
                <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use materials with high endurance limits, reduce stress concentrations, and apply surface treatments like polishing.</p>
                
                <h3>(c) Leaf Spring:</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A leaf spring is a type of spring made of multiple layers (leaves) of metal strips, used to absorb shocks and support loads, commonly in vehicle suspensions.</p>
                <p><strong>Construction:</strong> Leaves are stacked and held together by a center bolt, with the longest leaf at the top. The ends are often curled into eyes for attachment.</p>
                <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple design, high load-carrying capacity, and inherent damping due to friction between leaves.</p>
                <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in trucks, trailers, and railway carriages for suspension systems.</p>

                <h3>(e) Wahl’s Correction Factor:</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Wahl’s correction factor (K_w) is used in the design of helical springs to account for the effects of direct shear and curvature of the spring wire, which increase the stress beyond the basic torsional stress.</p>
                <p><strong>Formula:</strong> K_w = (4C - 1)/(4C - 4) + 0.615/C, where C is the spring index (C = D/d, D = mean coil diameter, d = wire diameter).</p>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> It adjusts the shear stress in the spring wire to ensure accurate design and prevent failure.</p>
                <p><strong>Application:</strong> Used in calculating the maximum shear stress in helical compression or tension springs.</p>
